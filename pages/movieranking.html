            It's my favorite movie.The impeccable storytelling through dialgoues and cinematography keeps you hooked from 
            the beggining to the very end.the relatable characters are the cherry on the top.I recommend this movie to everyone
            close to me.

            An anime that trenscends time, an all time classic.Evangelion is a timeless masterpiece.It has an artstyle that can never be replicated,
            the cultural influence it had through decades are nothing short of phenominal.But the love for evangelion comes from seeing yourself through Shinji's eyes(maybe not everytime).

            Yessss,this is also a five star solely for how cool the incantation of Shinji is aside from the fact that it has not only one of the best visual
            in all of anime but an amazing plot that keeps you sitting right on the edge of your sit the whole time.
